** HTTP1.1 **
It was created in 1997.
it loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded it blocks all other resources behind it.
Each request has to wait for the response before the next request can be sent.
It releis on the transportation layer to avoid buffer overflow so each TCP transactions requires a flow control mechanism.
HTTP1 dopes not use binary framing layer.

** HTTP/2 **
It was created in 2015, to solve the problems of HTTP1.1
It is much faster and more efficient than HTTP1.1
It uses single TCP connections to send multiple streams of data so ther is no blocking of resources
It uses multiplexing to allow concurrent request and responses over a single TCP connection
It uses a binary framing layer
